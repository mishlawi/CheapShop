# CheapShop

In REST folder, run `bash deploy.sh` to deploy a container for mysql, one for the api and one for the scrapers (auchan and pingo doce).

To connect to mysql database from your machine, use host `localhost`, port `3300`, username `root` and password `root`.

You can connect to the API from your machine using `localhost:8080`.

For now, scrapers run every minute from the moment the container is up (don't worry, they are only pushing dummy data to the db, not making actual scraping).
